# Deliverables
Included in the respository:  
- Scripts used to wrangle and analyzethe data  
- Tableau Public was used to create a dashboard to present data. Not all script results were presented in the story, only relevant analysis. Link for [Tableau Story Presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ioana.rusu2529/viz/AirbnbBerlin-RentalDataAnalysis_16977287846590/AirBnBBerlin)
